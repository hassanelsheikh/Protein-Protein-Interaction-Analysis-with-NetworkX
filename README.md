# Protein-Protein-Interaction-Analysis-with-NetworkX

#### Project Overview
This project involves analyzing a biological network of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) using the NetworkX Python package. The provided interactome file, "PathLinker_2018_human-ppi-weighted-cap0_75.txt," contains information about directed protein interactions, including the source and destination proteins, interaction confidence scores, and the method used to identify the interaction. The analysis includes constructing a graph from the interactome, identifying acyclic shortest paths between proteins, listing directly connected proteins, generating histograms of protein degrees, providing a conversion map between UniProt IDs and gene names, and converting the graph into an unweighted graph using an adjacency matrix.
